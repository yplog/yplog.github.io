## Hi, I'm YalÄ±n ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and programmer living in Ankara, Turkey.
I have been a [FSF](https://www.fsf.org/) member since 2015.
I contribute to open source projects. I worked at a startup for about a year.
I am currently working in a company that does various software projects.
In my spare time I'm busy lazing and developing projects.
You can check my geek code for more information.
